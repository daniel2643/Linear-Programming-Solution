# Linear-Programming-Solution
This project implements a solution for any generic linear programming problems.

## Description
Linear Programming (LP), also called linear optimization, which is a method to achieve the best solution (maximum or minimum) in a mathmatical model.


## Compliation
```
python3 Linear\ Programming.py <list1> <list2>
```
list1 is a matrix that representing the objective function.
list2 is a matrix which stands for all constraints.

The printed line would be the optimized solution for the problem.



## Algorithms
In this project, by using simplex method, it solves the algebraic solution with a gorgous tableau form. It applies matrix representation and matrix operations(row operation and column operation) to solve the problem.


## TO DO
In the project, the most difficult part for user is to model the real problem to a LP problem. Hence, if any intelligent way to simulate the modelling in computer, it could be increased to a higher level of intelligence to solve much more NP problems.
